My core skills include web design , front end development, UX and UI design.


Half a year ago i found my interest/passion in front-end devepment and the problem solving aspect of it.From that point on 
i started to learn as much as i could about front-end devepment(independent study).
For now i am a Freelance Front end web developer that tries to improve as much as i can to design cooler and bigger things in the future.

i like to solve complex and big problems in splitting them into multiple simple once to create efficient and clear solutions 
in my design and my code i like to work with big picture and goal im trying to accoplish in mind 
at the start of every project i want to look ahead/foresee and think/look for/of things that i need to do to 
i like to organize my projects 


I’m enjoy turning complex problems into simple,clean and user friendly designs. 

I’m constantly  learning web technologies and other design related topics, 
currently playing around with Javascript and JQuery.


When I’m not developing websites , I work out or relax playing games.
